      <p>The long-term effects of climate change will have detrimental consequences to the earth and
      its inhabitants. Increased events such as heat waves, precipitation, and the decreasing water
      resource will affect the lives of many. Furthermore, it has the potential to worsen air and
      water quality, which can increase health risks. The reality of climate change is that we
      don't have much time left until climate change becomes irreversible. Some say that the Climate
      catastrophe is 10 years away.</p>

      <p>Humans are the primary reason for climate change. According to <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/" target="_blank">NASA</a>:</p>
      <h3>"<em>In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.</em>"</h3>
      <p>Climate Change is real.</p>
