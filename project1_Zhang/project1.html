      <div class="meaning">What is Climate Change</div>
      <p>Most people by now have heard of the term <em>climate change</em> but might not
      necessarily know the real meaning of it. Climate Change, as the name suggests
      has to do with the changes in humidity and temperatures of a particular area.
      Due to human actions, these once-natural factors are now posing a threat to
      earth's natural ecosystems. Animals and the landscapes that surround them are
      negatively impacted by climate change. As such, global warming is one causation of this man-made
      phenomenom. </p>
