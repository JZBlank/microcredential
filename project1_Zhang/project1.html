      <div class="meaning">What is Climate Change?</div>
      <p>Most people by now have heard of the term <em>climate change</em> but might not
      necessarily know the real meaning of it. Climate Change, as the name suggests
      has to do with the changes in humidity and temperatures of a particular area.
      Due to human actions, these once-natural factors are now posing a threat to
      earth's natural ecosystems. Animals and the landscapes that surround them are
      negatively impacted by climate change. As such, global warming is one causation of this man-made
      phenomenom. <a href="#_discover"><span style="font-weight: bold">Discover more</a> and <a href="#_initiative"><span style="font-weight: bold">make a difference.</span></a> </p>

          <h1>Reality of Climate Change</h1>
          Currently, the world is warming faster now compared to any part of documented history.
          Factors that directly contribute to this are things like generating electricity
          and heat. Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas produce heat-trapping
          gasses that create molecules in the atmosphere that absorb light. This as a result
          forms a 'blanket' of gases around Earth. As a result, heat is unable to escape.
          Gases that are responsible for this include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
          and water vapor.

            Climate Change has real life consequences. Due to the increased heat in the atmosphere,
            polar ice caps are melting at a rate of almost 13% per decade.
             Moreover, the oldest ice in the Artic has
            declined by an overwhelming 95%. It is important to note that this drastically
            increases the sea level on Earth. If Climate Change is not stopped,
            coastal cities will cease to exist and the ecosystems that many animals rely on
            (including us humans) will collapse.
